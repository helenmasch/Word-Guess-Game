How users can get started with the project
# Instructions 
1. Build out the HTML code first to list the content of the website. 

2. After the HTML is completed, run the HTML in your browser.

3. After all content is created, create a new style.css file to customize your CSS. Link your style.css stylesheet into your HTML document. 

4. Create a new game.js file to use JavaScript and create the functions of your HTML. Link your game.js file as a script into your HTML document. 

NOTE: All files need to be created for the HTML to understand what its functions are and know what the element is doing.  

5. Create your variables in JavaScript first. Create a list of array's within your variable as a list. Which variables need functions to complete event?

6. After listing the variables start listing the event functions you'd like that variable to complete.
